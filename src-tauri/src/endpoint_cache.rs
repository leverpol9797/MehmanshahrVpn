//! Reuse of the warp-in-warp endpoints the core selected on the previous connect.
//!
//! The core ships its own endpoint cache (`AETHER_QUICK_RECONNECT` plus a
//! `-lastconn.toml` beside the identity config), but it is only wired into
//! `run_masque` and `run_wireguard`. The `Protocol::WarpInWarp` arm calls
//! `run_gool` without a `lastconn` path, so the cache is never read or written
//! for gool. Windows defaults to gool, which is why the shipped telemetry
//! records a cache hit rate of exactly zero across every retained attempt: the
//! setting was honoured, it just does not reach the protocol Windows uses.
//!
//! Aether v1.9.0 added `AETHER_WIW_PEERS`, which lets the caller hand both hops
//! back to the core, so the reuse can live here instead of waiting on upstream.
//!
//! A pin is a *hint*, never a shortcut. Four rules make that true, and each one
//! exists because of something the core does:
//!
//! * **Only endpoints that reached `Connected` are ever stored.** The reader
//!   observes the pair; nothing is written until the same attempt has passed the
//!   HTTPS data-plane probe, so a pair that merely opened a listener is not
//!   remembered.
//! * **A pin never shortens validation.** The cached attempt runs exactly the
//!   same probes as a scanned one.
//! * **A pin that does not work is deleted at once.** v1.9.0's `run_gool`
//!   deliberately never blacklists a hand-pinned hop - it logs "still retrying
//!   them" and keeps going - so a stale pin would otherwise be retried until the
//!   stall timeout. Invalidation has to happen on this side.
//! * **Values are re-parsed as `SocketAddr` before they are used.** The pair is
//!   recovered from a core log line, so treating it as opaque text would let a
//!   malformed line put arbitrary content into a child process environment.
//!   Parsing and re-rendering canonically removes that.
//!
//! The network a pin belongs to is resolved *once*, by the caller, before the
//! core starts - see `network_fingerprint`. Both `load` and `store` are handed
//! that one value rather than each computing its own, because the two calls
//! happen on opposite sides of the tunnel coming up and would otherwise be
//! describing different interfaces.
